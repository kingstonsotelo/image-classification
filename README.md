# Project: Image classification using convolutional neural network

## Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- tesorflow

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Code

Main code is provided in the `image_classification.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `helper.py` and 'problem_unittests.py' Python file to complete your work. 

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook image_classification.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook image_classification.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data
